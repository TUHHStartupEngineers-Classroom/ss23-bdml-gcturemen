Employee attrition leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff.\n\nOur goal is to use classification models to predict if an employee is likely to quit so that the situation can be intervened on time and remedied to prevent attrition.\n\n# Objectives\n\nUse your learning from descriptive features and `plot_ggpairs()` to further investigate the features and answer the related questions.\n\n# Solution\n\n## Import Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='03_aml_with_h2o_i_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_d5aa22655d570af350b2821796592e89'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(GGally)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Read Data\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='03_aml_with_h2o_i_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_7de5736546c40221fd7503173259b68e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nemployee_attrition_tbl <- read_csv(\n  \"~/GitHub/ss23-bdml-gcturemen/code_drafts/data/datasets-1067-1925-WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='03_aml_with_h2o_i_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_5f291c9887825713fa125399f37d9e2f'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> Rows: 1,470\n#> Columns: 35\n#> $ Age                      <dbl> 41, 49, 37, 33, 27, 32, 59, 30, 38, 36, 35, 2…\n#> $ Attrition                <chr> \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"…\n#> $ BusinessTravel           <chr> \"Travel_Rarely\", \"Travel_Frequently\", \"Travel…\n#> $ DailyRate                <dbl> 1102, 279, 1373, 1392, 591, 1005, 1324, 1358,…\n#> $ Department               <chr> \"Sales\", \"Research & Development\", \"Research …\n#> $ DistanceFromHome         <dbl> 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 24, 23, 27, 16, 15, 26, …\n#> $ Education                <dbl> 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, …\n#> $ EducationField           <chr> \"Life Sciences\", \"Life Sciences\", \"Other\", \"L…\n#> $ EmployeeCount            <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n#> $ EmployeeNumber           <dbl> 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,…\n#> $ EnvironmentSatisfaction  <dbl> 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3, …\n#> $ Gender                   <chr> \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"…\n#> $ HourlyRate               <dbl> 94, 61, 92, 56, 40, 79, 81, 67, 44, 94, 84, 4…\n#> $ JobInvolvement           <dbl> 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, …\n#> $ JobLevel                 <dbl> 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, …\n#> $ JobRole                  <chr> \"Sales Executive\", \"Research Scientist\", \"Lab…\n#> $ JobSatisfaction          <dbl> 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, …\n#> $ MaritalStatus            <chr> \"Single\", \"Married\", \"Single\", \"Married\", \"Ma…\n#> $ MonthlyIncome            <dbl> 5993, 5130, 2090, 2909, 3468, 3068, 2670, 269…\n#> $ MonthlyRate              <dbl> 19479, 24907, 2396, 23159, 16632, 11864, 9964…\n#> $ NumCompaniesWorked       <dbl> 8, 1, 6, 1, 9, 0, 4, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, …\n#> $ Over18                   <chr> \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", \"Y\", …\n#> $ OverTime                 <chr> \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\",…\n#> $ PercentSalaryHike        <dbl> 11, 23, 15, 11, 12, 13, 20, 22, 21, 13, 13, 1…\n#> $ PerformanceRating        <dbl> 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n#> $ RelationshipSatisfaction <dbl> 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, …\n#> $ StandardHours            <dbl> 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 8…\n#> $ StockOptionLevel         <dbl> 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, …\n#> $ TotalWorkingYears        <dbl> 8, 10, 7, 8, 6, 8, 12, 1, 10, 17, 6, 10, 5, 3…\n#> $ TrainingTimesLastYear    <dbl> 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, …\n#> $ WorkLifeBalance          <dbl> 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, …\n#> $ YearsAtCompany           <dbl> 6, 10, 0, 8, 2, 7, 1, 1, 9, 7, 5, 9, 5, 2, 4,…\n#> $ YearsInCurrentRole       <dbl> 4, 7, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 4, 5, 2, 2, 2, …\n#> $ YearsSinceLastPromotion  <dbl> 0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 7, 0, 0, 4, 1, 0, …\n#> $ YearsWithCurrManager     <dbl> 5, 7, 0, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 8, 7, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Compensation Features\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='03_aml_with_h2o_i_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_f4fcc70655e0488bf08337c6e31adc3f'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_aml_with_h2o_i_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n__Question:__ What can you deduce about the interaction between Monthly Income and Attrition?\n\n    a.
